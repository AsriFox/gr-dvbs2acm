    /* Coarse frequency offset estimation
     *
     * The frequency synchronizer offers two coarse estimation options: based on the SOF
     * only and based on the entire PLHEADER. The PLHEADER version requires the expected
     * PLHEADER symbols, which, in turn, requires accurate decoding of the PLSC
     * beforehand. This is a chicken-and-egg situation, because an accurate coarse
     * frequency offset estimation is typically required to decode the PLSC well.
     *
     * To work around this limitation, the adopted strategy is as follows:
     *
     * - On startup, while not coarse-corrected yet, estimate the coarse frequency offset
     *   based on the SOF only. Do not rely on the decoded PLSC, as it could be poorly
     *   decoded. Assume that, so long as the SOF-based estimation accumulates a
     *   sufficient number of frames, eventually it will lead to a reasonable estimate,
     *   accurate enough to bring the residual frequency offset within the fine estimation
     *   range (i.e., to enter the "coarse-corrected" state).
     *
     * - Once in coarse-corrected state, assume the PLSC decoding is now sufficiently
     *   accurate, such that it is possible to tell the true PLHEADER symbols on each
     *   frame with good confidence. Hence, start estimating the coarse frequency offset
     *   based on the entire PLHEADER. At this point, the PLHEADER phase should rotate by
     *   no more than roughly 0.2 degrees in the course of 90 symbols. Hence, the residual
     *   frequency offset should be harmless to the PLSC decoding.
     *
     * This strategy determines whether or not to use the full PLHEADER for the
     * estimation. The next question is when to execute the estimation, before or after
     * the PLSC decoding. The order is important because the PLSC decoding step can use
     * the frequency offset estimate to derotate the PLHEADER symbols before attempting to
     * decode the underlying PLS code (see the open-loop operation there).
     *
     * Naturally, the coarse frequency offset estimation is called right away (before PLSC
     * decoding) when based on the SOF symbols only. The advantage of this choice is that
     * the subsequent PLSC decoding step can already benefit from the coarse frequency
     * offset estimate when running in open loop (again, to derotate the PLHEADER). In
     * contrast, the coarse estimation is called after PLSC decoding when based on the
     * full PLHEADER, since it needs the PLSC information.
     *
     * Besides, when the PLSC decoder is disabled (i.e., when the PLSC is known a priori),
     * the coarse frequency offset estimation can always use the full PLHEADER. In this
     * case, even if the estimate is poor (e.g., before locking the frame timing), it does
     * not compromise the PLSC decoding, since there is no decoding. Also, in this
     * scenario, there is no question as to whether the estimation should be called before
     * or after the PLSC decoding, because, again, there is no decoding.
     *
     * Finally, it's important to understand the motivation for using the full PLHEADER in
     * the coarse frequency offset estimation. If it has the risk of corrupting the
     * estimation due to an erroneously decoded PLSC, why bother about it? The reason is
     * that it achieves significantly superior performance. By using the full PLHEADER,
     * the estimates are based on more data points, namely more extensive averaging, which
     * is helpful to avoid eventual noisy estimates. This is particularly useful because
     * the coarse estimation continues even after entering the coarse-corrected state, as
     * a way to periodically verify the residual frequency offset is low enough to be
     * captured by the fine frequency offset estimator. In this process, it is crucial to
     * avoid noisy coarse estimates that could bring the synchronizer out of the
     * coarse-corrected state, as it takes long to recover this state (depending on the
     * freq_sync.period parameter), and the receiver cannot operate reliably before that.
     * Namely, a noisy estimate exceeding the fine estimation range would easily lead to
     * the loss of a few frames until a better estimate is obtained.
