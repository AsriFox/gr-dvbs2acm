/**
 * @brief Fixed-size delay-line with contiguous storage of volk-aligned elements
 *
 * Wrapper around the cdeque (contiguous double-ended queue) that implements a
 * delay line, whose newest and oldest elements lie on the tail and head
 * indexes, respectively. This implementation is meant to be used on tapped
 * delay line algorithms, such as digital filters.
 *
 * Unlike cdeque, the delay line always returns the most recent to oldest
 * samples when reading from tail to head. To ensure that, it only supports
 * writing of new elements on the queue's back.
