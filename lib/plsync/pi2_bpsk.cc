     * The i-th differential pi/2 BPSK demapping is based on the product
     * "conj(in[i]) * in[i-1]", namely the phase rotation from symbol i-1 to
     * symbol i. The result depends on the evenness/oddness of the index
     * transition. In the sequel, we assume the local indexing convention
     * (starting from 0), as opposed to the convention adopted by the DVB-S2
     * standard (starting from 1).
     *
     * Due to the nature of the pi/2 BPSK mapping, the phase change between
     * consecutive symbols is always +-pi/2. Correspondingly, the product
     * "conj(in[i]) * in[i-1]" always results in either +j or -j. The key for
     * differentially demapping is to formulate a table of possible results for
     * even-to-odd and odd-to-even index transitions and demap the i-th symbol
     * based on that.
     *
     * To do so, it is instructive to express the mapping on "pi2_bpsk_map" (see
     * the "map_bpsk" function) in complex exponential notation:
     *
     *     Local even index (odd index on the standard's convention):
     *
     *     {
     *         expj(pi/4),  // bit 0
     *         expj(-3pi/4) // bit 1
     *     }
     *
     *     Local odd index (even index on the standard's convention):
     *
     *     {
     *         expj(3pi/4), // bit 0
     *         expj(-pi/4)  // bit 1
     *     }
     *
     * Next, we investigate the possible conjugate products for pairs of bits
     * representing symbol i-1 and symbol i, in that order. On an even-to-odd
     * transition (e.g., from i-1=0 to i=1), the results are as follows:
     *
     *     00 -> expj(pi/4) * conj(expj(3pi/4))   = expj(-pi/2)  = -j
     *     01 -> expj(pi/4) * conj(expj(-pi/4))   = expj(pi/2)   = +j
     *     10 -> expj(-3pi/4) * conj(expj(3pi/4)) = expj(-3pi/2) = +j
     *     11 -> expj(-3pi/4) * conj(expj(-pi/4)) = expj(-pi/2)  = -j
     *
     * Similarly, on an odd-to-even transition (e.g., from i-1=1 to i=2), the
     * results are as follows:
     *
     *     00 -> expj(3pi/4) * conj(expj(pi/4))   = expj(pi/2)  = +j
     *     01 -> expj(3pi/4) * conj(expj(-3pi/4)) = expj(3pi/2) = -j
     *     10 -> expj(-pi/4) * conj(expj(pi/4))   = expj(-pi/2) = -j
     *     11 -> expj(-pi/4) * conj(expj(-3pi/4)) = expj(pi/2)  = +j
     *
     * With that, we can formulate the decision rule. We always need to check:
     * 1) the current index's evenness/oddness; 2) the previous bit; 3) whether
     * the current differential is +j or -j.
     *
     * On an even-to-odd transition, we have the following rules:
     *
     *     - If imag(conj(in[i]) * in[i-1]) > 0, bit[i] = !bit[i-1].
     *     - If imag(conj(in[i]) * in[i-1]) < 0, bit[i] = bit[i-1].
     *
     * In contrast, on an odd-to-even transition, we have the opposite:
     *
     *     - If imag(conj(in[i]) * in[i-1]) > 0, bit[i] = bit[i-1].
     *     - If imag(conj(in[i]) * in[i-1]) < 0, bit[i] = !bit[i-1].
     *
     * Ultimately, the decision process can be implemented as follows:
     *
     *    - Start with bit[i] = bit[i-1];
     *    - Flip the bit if imag(conj(in[i]) * in[i-1]) < 0.
     *    - Flip the bit if i is odd (i.e., on an even-to-odd transition).
     *
     * Importantly, note this function assumes the complex array pointed by
     * parameter *in starts with the last SOF symbol and points to a sequence of
     * up to 65 symbols. That's because it requires 65 symbols to
     * differentially-decode the 64 PLSC symbols. As a result, the first
     * transition is always assumed to be an odd-to-even transition, from
     * PLHEADER bit 25 (last SOF bit) to bit 26 (first PLSC bit).
     *
     * The last SOF symbol is known to be expj(3pi/4), as it lies on an odd
     * index (25) and represents bit=0. However, note the whole point of
     * differential detection is that the symbols can be rotated/rotating, so
     * the actual incoming phase is unknown. Hence, this function needs to
     * process the last SOF symbol too, instead of simply starting with its
     * hard-coded value expj(3pi/4).
