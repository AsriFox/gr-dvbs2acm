/**
 * \brief Frame Synchronizer
 *
 * Searches for the start of PLFRAMEs by computing and adding independent
 * cross-correlations between the SOF and the PLSC parts of the PLHEADER with
 * respect to their expected values known a priori. The cross-correlations are
 * based on the so-called *differential* metric given by `x[n]*conj(x[n+1])`,
 * namely based on the angle difference between consecutive symbols. This
 * non-coherent approach allows for frame synchronization despite the presence
 * of large frequency offsets. That's crucial because the fine frequency offset
 * estimation requires correct decoding of the PLSC, which, in turn, requires
 * the frame search provided by the frame synchronizer. Hence, the frame
 * synchronizer should act first, before the carrier recovery.
 *
 * Due to the interleaved Reed-Muller codeword construction (with a XOR given by
 * the 7th PLSC bit), each pair of consecutive PLSC bits is either of equal or
 * opposite bits. When the 7th PLSC bit is 0, all pairs of bits are equal, i.e.,
 * `b[2i+1] = b[2i]`. In this case, the corresponding pair of scrambled bits are
 * either equal to the original scrambler bits (when `b[2i] = b[2i+1] = 0`) or
 * their opposite (when `b[2i] = b[2i+1] = 1`). In either case, the complex
 * differential `x[2i]*conj(x[2i+1])` is the same due to the pi/2 BPSK mapping
 * (refer to the even-to-odd mapping rules in the body of function
 * `demap_bpsk_diff()` from `pi2_bpsk.cc`). Hence, when the 7th PLSC bit is 0,
 * the differential is determined by the scrambler sequence, not the actual PLSC
 * value that is unknown at this point.
 *
 * Next, consider the case when the 7th PLSC bit is 1 such that each pair of
 * PLSC bits is composed of opposite bits, i.e., `b[2i+1] = !b[2i]`. In this
 * case, if `b[2i] = 0` and `b[2i+1] = 1`, the pair of scrambled bits becomes
 * `(s[2i], !s[2i+1])`. Otherwise, if `b[2i] = 1` and `b[2i+1] = 0`, the pair of
 * scrambled bits becomes `(!s[2i], s[2i+1])`. In either case, the complex
 * differential is equal to the differential due to the scrambler sequence
 * alone, but shifted by 180 degrees (i.e., by `expj(j*pi)`, due to the pi/2
 * BPSK mapping rules (again, see `demap_bpsk_diff()`). Thus, if the
 * differentials due to the PLSC scrambler sequence are used as the correlator
 * taps, the cross-correlation still yields a peak when processing the PLSC. The
 * only difference is that the phase of the peak will be shifted by 180 degrees,
 * but the magnitude will be the same. In this case, the 180-degree shift can be
 * undone by taking the negative of the correlator peak.
 *
 * In the end, the PLSC correlator is implemented based on the scrambler
 * sequence alone (known a priori), and it is independent of the actual PLSC
 * embedded on each incoming PLHEADER. This correlator is composed of 32 taps
 * only, given that only the pairwise PLSC differentials are known a priori. In
 * contrast, the SOF correlator is based on all the 25 known SOF differentials,
 * given that the entire 26-symbol SOF sequence is known a priori.
 *
 * The two correlators (SOF and PLSC) are expected to peak when they observe the
 * SOF or PLSC in the input symbol sequence. The final timing metric is given by
 * the sum or difference of these correlators, whichever has the largest
 * magnitude. The sum (SOF + PLSC) peaks when the 7th PLSC bit is 0, and the
 * difference (SOF - PLSC) peaks when the 7th PLSC bit is 1. That is, the
 * difference metric essentially undoes the 180-degree shift on the PLSC
 * correlator peak that would arise when the 7th bit is 1.
 *
 * Furthermore, as stated before, the implementation is robust to frequency
 * offsets. The input symbol sequence can have any frequency offset, as long as
 * it doesn't change significantly in the course of the PLHEADER, which is
 * typically the case given that the PLHEADER is short enough (for typical
 * DVB-S2 baud rates). If the frequency offset is the same for symbols x[n] and
 * x[n+1], the differential metric includes a factor given by:
 *
 * ```
 * exp(j*2*pi*f0*n) * conj(exp(j*2*pi*f0*(n+1))) = exp(-j*2*pi*f0).
 * ```
 *
 * Moreover, if the frequency offset remains the same over the entire PLHEADER,
 * all differentials include this factor. Ultimately, the cross-correlation peak
 * is still observed, just with a different phase (shifted by `-2*pi*f0`). In
 * fact, the phase of the complex timing metric (sum or difference between the
 * correlator peaks) could be used to estimate the coarse frequency offset
 * affecting the PLHEADER. However, a better method is implemented on the
 * dedicated `freq_sync` class.
 *
 * Lastly, aside from the correlators, the implementation comprises a state
 * machine with three states: "searching", "found", and "locked". As soon as an
 * SOF is found, the state machine changes to the "found" state. At this point,
 * the caller should decode the corresponding PLSC and call method
 * `set_frame_len()` to inform the expected PLFRAME length following the
 * detected SOF. Then, if the next SOF comes exactly after the informed frame
 * length, the state machine changes into the "locked" state. From this point
 * on, the frame synchronizer will check the correlation peak (i.e., the
 * so-called "timing metric") at the expected index on every frame.
 *
 * Whenever the timing metric does not exceed a specific magnitude threshold,
 * the implementation will increment an internal count for unlocking. After a
 * chosen number of consecutive timing metric failures, this block will assume
 * the frame lock has been lost and transition back to the "searching" state. At
 * this point, it takes at least two more PLHEADERs to recover the lock, as the
 * state machine needs to go over the "found" and "locked" states again.
