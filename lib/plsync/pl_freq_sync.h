/* The pilot-mode fine frequency offset estimate is based on the phase difference
 * accumulated between consecutive pilot blocks, i.e., after an interval of 1440+36=1476
 * symbols. Hence, the maximum observable frequency offset is given by:
 *
 * 1/(2*(1440 + 36)) = 3.3875e-4
 *
 * When the frequency offset exceeds this, the phase changes by more than +-pi from pilot
 * segment to pilot segment. Consequently, the fine estimation approach does not work.
 *
 * When including the PLHEADER phase within the fine frequency estimate, note the interval
 * between the PLHEADER and the first pilot block is slightly different (of 1440 + 90
 * symbols). However, the fine frequency offset estimator considers only the last 36
 * symbols of the plheader, which preserves the interval of 1476 symbols.
 *
 * Besides, note the pilotless-mode fine frequency offset estimate has a different upper
 * limit for the observable frequency offset, which depends on the PLFRAME length. Hence,
 * the pilotless-mode estimator does not use the above constant. See the implementation at
 * `estimate_fine_pilotless_mode()`.

/**
 * @brief Frequency Synchronizer
 *
 * Provides methods to estimate the coarse and fine frequency offsets disturbing DVB-S2
 * frames, as well as methods to estimate the phases of various frame segments (SOF,
 * PLHEADER, and pilot blocks). These methods are meant to be used in conjunction with an
 * external frequency correction (or de-rotator/rotator) block. This class supplies the
 * frequency offset estimates, while the external block applies the corrections, an
 * operation denominated "closed-loop mode". In other words, this class is not responsible
 * for frequency offset correction. Instead, it focuses on estimation only.
 *
 * Due to the closed-loop operation, when estimating the phases of the SOF, PLHEADER, and
 * pilot blocks, this class assumes the symbols are not rotating. This assumption holds
 * closely as soon as the external rotator block converges to an accurate frequency
 * correction. Thus, the phase estimates are obtained by assuming the symbols are only
 * disturbed by white Gaussian noise. The only exception is on the `derotate_plheader()`
 * method, which offers an "open-loop" option, documented there.
 *
 * Once the frequency offset estimates are accurate enough, the external derotator block
 * applies accurate corrections and the frequency offset observed by this block becomes
 * sufficiently low. Moreover, once the normalized frequency offset magnitude falls below
 * 3.268e-4, this class infers the system is already "coarse-corrected", and the
 * corresponding state can be fetched through the `is_coarse_corrected()` method. At this
 * point, it makes sense to start computing the fine frequency offset estimate. Before
 * that, the fine frequency offset estimates are not reliable.
 *
 * Once a fine frequency offset becomes available, this class returns true on method
 * `has_fine_foffset_est()`. As of this version, a fine offset can be computed whenever
 * the processed DVB-S2 frames contain pilot blocks and the system is already
 * coarse-corrected. The estimate is based on the independent phases of each pilot block
 * composing the frame, and is obtained by calling method `estimate_fine_pilot_mode()`.
 *
 * In contrast, the coarse frequency offset can be computed regardless of the presence of
 * pilots. Also, unlike the fine frequency offset estimation, which is computed and
 * refreshed on every frame, the coarse estimation is based on several consecutive frames.
 * The number of frames considered in the computation is determined by the `period`
 * parameter provided to the constructor.
 *
 * In any case, the most recent coarse and fine frequency offset estimates can be fetched
 * independently through the `get_coarse_foffset()` and `get_fine_foffset()` methods.
