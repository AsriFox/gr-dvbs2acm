 * \brief PL Descrambler

 * Multiplies the scrambled payload of a PLFRAME by the conjugate of the complex
 * randomization sequence used on the Tx side for PL scrambling. This multiplication
 * effectively undoes the scrambling, and the resulting descrambled payload is stored
 * internally for later access through the `get_payload()` method. This processes depends
 * only on the Gold code defining the complex scrambling sequence, which must be provided
